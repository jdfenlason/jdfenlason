### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Jake Fenlason, and I am a retired professional soccer player turned Front-End Software Engineer. After a five-year professional career, playing against Ballon d'Or winners and World Cup Champions, I felt it was time for a change. In looking for what life would be like after soccer, I wanted something that would be challenging, stimulating, and rewarding. I fell in love with web development instantly. Figuring out challenging problems gave me the same rush that I felt when I was playing soccer. I'm super proud of my first front-end solo project called StarGazer https://jdfenlason.github.io/StarGazer/.

I am an avid homebrewer and beer affocianado.  I am a certified Cicerone and love to talk beer or soccer!
