### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Jake Fenlason, and I am a retired professional soccer player turned Front-End Software Engineer. After a five-year professional career, playing against Ballon D'Ore and World Cup Champions, I felt it was time for a change. In looking for what life would be like after soccer, I wanted something that would be challenging, stimulating, and rewarding. I fell in love with web development instantly. Figuring out challenging problems gave me the same rush that I felt when I was playing soccer. I'm super proud of my first front-end solo project called StarGazer (https://github.com/jdfenlason/StarGazer).

My background in History and Political Science has been integral in my programming journey thus far. It has helped me communicate complex ideas and, more importantly, research and effectively learn new concepts. I am excited by the learning process and plan on utilizing all the tools I am developing in my next role.

I am an avid homebrewer and beer affocianado.  I am a certified Cicerone and love to talk beer or soccer!
