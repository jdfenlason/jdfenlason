## About Me ⚽️

Hello! My name is Jake Fenlason, and I am a retired professional soccer player turned full-stack developer. After a five-year professional career, playing against Ballon d'Or winners and World Cup Champions, I felt it was time for a change. In looking for what life would be like after soccer, I wanted something that would be challenging, stimulating, and rewarding.


I fell in love with programming instantly. Figuring out challenging problems gave me the same rush that I felt when I was playing soccer.  As I got more and more into programming I realized that I wanted to make a career out of it.  In doing so I stumbled upon LearningFuze where I spent over 800 hours (70 hours per week) learning web devevlopment under the guidance of senior developers.  

Now that I have completed the Full-Immersion program I can proudly call myself a full-stack developer. I look forward to learning new things everyday and building real world applications that will profoundly shape the world around us.
