## About Me ‚öΩÔ∏è

Hello! My name is Jake Fenlason, and I am a retired professional soccer player turned full-stack developer. After a five-year professional career, playing against Ballon d'Or winners and World Cup Champions, I felt it was time for a change. In looking for what life would be like after soccer, I wanted something that would be challenging, stimulating, and rewarding.


I fell in love with programming instantly. Figuring out challenging problems gave me the same rush that I felt when I was playing soccer.  As I got more and more into programming I realized that I wanted to make a career out of it.  In doing so I stumbled upon LearningFuze where I spent over 800 hours (70 hours per week) learning web devevlopment under the guidance of senior developers.  

Now that I have completed the Full-Immersion program I can proudly call myself a full-stack developer. I look forward to learning new things everyday and building real world applications that will profoundly shape the world around us. 

Don't hesitate to reach out! My contact information is below in the contact me section!
